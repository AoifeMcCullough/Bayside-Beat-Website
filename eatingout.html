  <h3> Eating out in San Francisco</h3>
  <p>The San Francisco food scene is one of America’s most exciting as it offers a unique combination of quality local ingredients and avant-garde thinking.  Alongside Silicon Valley and the ‘Summer of Love’, the Bay Area is also home to the farmers’ markets that helped kick-start the trends for local, seasonal and organic produce. The patron saint of these movements is Berkeley chef Alice Waters, who started preaching 'the gospel’ at her restaurant Chez Panisse back in the 1970s.</p>

  <p>For a look at what this abundant growing region can offer, visit San Francisco’s famed Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, held Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings. This is where many of the city’s top chefs forage not only for fruits, vegetables and flowers but also artisan products such as Acme Bread and the Cowgirl Creamery’s prize-winning cheeses. A quarter of California is devoted to farmlands, which range climatically from Mediterranean to dry desert. And just north of San Francisco, there are over 600 wineries in the counties of Napa and Sonoma.</p>

        <h3>Restaurants</h3>
        <p>100 restaurants, that seems like a lot of restaurants, but in San Francisco that number barely covers the creme de la creme. No other area of the country has a more dynamic scene, and it keeps getting better.</p>

        <h3>Coffee Shops</h3>
        <p>The best coffee shops and cafés in San Francisco
        Impeccably sourced, small batch, locally roasted… San Franciscans expect a lot more than caffeine from a cup of coffee—and the city’s best coffee shops deliver.</p>

       <h3>Markets</h3>
       <p>Cradled by the heartland of the USA’s most abundant agricultural areas, San Francisco is home to some of the nation’s first farmers’ markets. With more local markets across all of the city’s neighbourhoods than one could ever hope to patronize, San Francisco’s markets also give back to the community, supporting civic education and local music. Likewise, the Bay is no stranger to food trucks, pop up markets and gourmet food products.</p>
